# Goal:
To create a fullstack bakery website that displays information on cookies, cakes and muffins offered for sale as well as enables someone to receive a catalog of items sold via email.

# Learning Objectives:  
Upon successful completion of this project, the student will demonstrate their understanding of how to use API Wrappers in Ruby as well how to create a website using the Sinatra microframework.

# Instructions:
Your friend is a baker who recently had a grand opening of their store. Unfortunately, the turnout was less than ideal and your friend suggested creating a website. The goal is to improve the storeâ€™s online presence and hopefully increase foot traffic to the store. Naturally, your friend turns to you for help and hands you some starting suggestions in a google document.

# Client Suggestions:
I want it to look and feel like a bakery website
- The front page should
- all cookies
- all cakes
- all muffins
- provide information about the bakery
- have links to pages where you can see
Each item sold should have:
-a description
-a price
There should be a way for a person on the site to receive an email with a catalog of all items sold
